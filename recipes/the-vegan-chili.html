    <h2><strong>The Vegan Chili:</strong> an explosion of flavor</h2>

    <br><strong>The Vegan Chili</strong> is the only chili you'll ever need! Forget the European versions with cheap ground pork and canned corn, which end up tasting like nothing. 
    <br>This chili, which contains no meat or substitutes, is a pure explosion of flavor in your mouth that you'll rarely have experienced before.
        
    <br>The main ingredients, besides the many spices, are beans of your choice, chopped or peeled tomatoes, onions, lots of garlic, vegetable broth,
    <br>cilantro and, depending on how spicy you like it, jalapeños. You can let your creativity run wild with the toppings, or use leftovers. 
    <br>I recommend vegan cold cream to balance out the spiciness and heat, chopped red onions or spring onions, and parsley. Round it off with a lime to add a little fresh acidity. 
    <br>The only downside to this dish is that it doesn't cook quickly. Start early and be prepared to stir a lot! But before you bounce from the recipe: the preparation is super quick.</div>

    <li> Vegan sour cream or diced avocado</li>
    <li> Sliced scallions or chopped cilantro</li>

    <h2>How to make The Vegan Chili:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat a large pot or a deep pan with a lid over medium to high heat. Add the olive oil and, once it starts to shimmer, add the onions and season them with a few pinches of salt. Cook for about 10 minutes,
    <br>stirring frequently, until the onions turn nicely golden. If they begin to brown too quickly around the edges, stir more often and or add a small splash of water.</br></li></p>
    <p><li>Add the garlic, jalapeños, and tomato paste. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the tomato paste darkens slightly. 
    <br>If the mixture starts to stick or looks too dry, add a splash of water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan.</br></li></p>
    <p><li>Stir in the chili powder, cumin, paprika, and oregano and cook for about 30 seconds, stirring vigorously to release their aromas.</li></p>
    <p><li>Deglaze with the red wine, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any stuck bits. Let it simmer rapidly for 3 to 4 minutes.</li></p>
    <p><li>Add the vegetable broth, beans, cocoa powder, bay leaves, soy sauce, hand-crushed tomatoes with their juices, salt, black pepper to taste, and 1 tablespoon of maple syrup. Stir well to combine.</li></p>
    <p><li>Bring the chili to a boil over high heat, then reduce to a gentle simmer. Avoid boiling or simmering too vigorously, as this can cause the beans to break down too much.</li></p>
    <p><li>Let the chili cook for about 1½ hours, or up to 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until it becomes thick and creamy and the flavors are fully developed. Remove the bay leaves.</li></p>
    <p><li>Stir in 1 tablespoon of lime juice, the vinegar, and the coriander. Taste and adjust as needed, adding more lime juice for acidity 
    <br>and up to 2 additional tablespoons of maple syrup to balance bitterness. Season with salt and pepper if necessary.</br></li></p>
    <p><li>If you like, you can serve the chili with rice on the side. However, this is optional and not really recommended, as it can dilute the flavor.</li></p>
    <p><li>Serve with toppings of your choice, such as red onions, chopped coriander, sliced spring onions, vegan sour cream, avocado, tortilla chips, and more.</li></p>

    <h2>Last words:</h2>

    <br>Credit goes to Nisha Vora from rainbowplantlife.com for the idea for this chili. I just simplified it a little and adapted it to the European market, because many of the ingredients are difficult to find. 
    <br>I can only thank her, because this chili completely changed my view of chilies, which we know very differently in Europe. 
    <br>The mixture of the many spices completely blew my mind the first time I tried it. We're just not used to that kind of thing. But after I ate it, I couldn't get enough.
