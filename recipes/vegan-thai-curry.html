    <li> 3 tablespoons of red curry paste or curry powder</li>
    <li> 3 tablespoons of soy sauce</li>
    <li> 1-2 teaspoons of paprika or chili powder, according to taste</li>
    <li> 2 teaspoons of rice vinegar or a squeeze of lime juice</li>            
    <li> 1 ½ cans (600 ml) of coconut milk and ½ cup (120 ml) of vegetable broth</li>
    <li> 1 can or jar of chickpeas</li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon of coconut sugar (optional, adjust to taste)</li>
</ul>
    
    <h4>For the topping: </h4>
<ul>    
    <li> unsalted peanuts</li>
    <li> fresh mint</li>
    <li> cooked rice</li>
    <li> coconut yoghurt</li>
    <li> lime </li>
</ul>

    <h2>How to make this recipe:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat some coconut oil in a large, deep pan or pot and roast the onions until they turn translucent. Add the carrots and cook briefly, then stir in the pumpkin, bell peppers, garlic, and ginger.
    <br>Continue cooking for a few minutes until the vegetables start to soften. Mix in the red curry paste, paprika, soy sauce, and rice vinegar (or lime juice). Finally, stir in the coconut milk and vegetable broth and bring the mixture to a gentle boil.</br></li></p>
    <p><li>Let the curry simmer, covered, for about 5-10 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the sauce is creamy. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt, pepper, more curry paste, or a little coconut sugar if a sweeter flavor is desired. 
    <br>Fold in the chickpeas and cook a few more minutes until heated through. If the curry is too thin, stir in some cornstarch or roux together with the chickpeas to thicken it.</br></li></p>
    <p><li>Serve and garnish! Top with as much as you like with coconut yogurt, raw diced onions, peanuts, and freshly chopped mint as desired. Serve alongside rice and lime wedges. Enjoy!</li></p>
