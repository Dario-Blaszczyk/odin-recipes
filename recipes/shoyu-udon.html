    <h2>This <strong>Shoyu Udon Broth</strong> warms your heart</h2>

    <br>A <strong>shoyu udon broth</strong> with shiitake mushrooms, glazed chicken, pak choi, and spring onions where simple preparation meets complex flavors.
        
    <br>I adapted this broth with udon noodles from a ramen recipe. It has an incredibly intense flavor, 
    <br>offers plenty of variety, and is very filling. It's especially enjoyable on colder evenings and easy to prepare.
    <br>Not only is it warming and healthy, it also looks beautiful. Your guests will be delighted!</div>

    <li> 3 tablespoon honey</li>
    <li> 1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>

    <h2>How to make the Shoyu Udon Broth:</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Start by placing a small pot (or steamer) on the stove with only water in it. When the water starts to steam, place the shiitake mushrooms together with the  
    <br>individual leaves of the pak choi (or Chinese cabbage leaves) on a steamer insert and close the lid. Turn down the heat so that the water does not start to boil vigorously.</br></li></p>
    <p><li>Meanwhile, heat a pan on high heat. Once it has reached the desired temperature (water drop test), lower the heat 
    <br>and add the oil with the spring onions, garlic, ginger and miso paste and sauté for about 40 seconds until you can smell the aroma.</br></li></p>
    <p><li>Pour in the stock followed by the soy sauce and stir to combine. Bring the broth to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. Continue to simmer the sauce for 5-10 minutes. </li></p>
    <p><li>Season the broth with salt to taste. Keep warm until ready to use.</li></p>
    <p><li>Start by heating a large sauté pan over medium to high heat.</li></p>
    <p><li>As the pan warms up, combine the soy sauce, honey, and garlic in a small bowl and mix well. Set the mixture aside for later use.</li></p>
    <p><li>Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel to remove any excess moisture. Pour in enough oil to lightly coat the base of the pan and allow it to heat thoroughly.</li></p>
    <p><li>Once the oil begins to lightly smoke, add the chicken to the pan with the skin facing down. Sear for around 3 minutes, or until the skin turns golden brown. 
    <br>Turn the chicken over, lower the heat to medium, and continue cooking for another 4 to 6 minutes, until fully cooked and nicely browned on the second side.</br></li></p>
    <p><li>Brush the chicken with the glaze, turning it and applying more glaze until both sides are evenly coated. 
    <br>Transfer the chicken to a cooling rack set over a baking sheet and keep it there until ready to serve.</li></p>
    <p><li>Finally, fill a small pot with lightly salted water and bring it to a boil. Once it boils, 
    <br>add the udon noodles to the water and cook them according to the package instructions. Drain the water and set aside to serve.</li></p>    
    <p><li>To serve, take a bowl, add a portion of the udon noodles, and fill it 2/3 full with the broth. 
    <br>Now place your steamed vegetables and glazed chicken individually on the sides. Sprinkle some of the chopped spring onions, sesame seeds, and peanuts on top. 
    <br>Finish it off with a few drops of sesame oil. If there is any glaze left in the pan from the chicken, use a spoon to drizzle it over the topping.</li></p>
