# odin-recipes
Project: Recipes as part of The Odin Project HTML Basics Course.

In this project, I will demonstrate that I have a basic knowledge of HTML and can apply it. The goal is to create an index page written purely in HTML that links to recipe pages.

In doing so, I will apply all the practices I have learned so far:
- Use of git and Github
- Use of the VS Code text editor
- Command line basics
- Elements and tags
- Boilerplate
- Working with text
- Lists and links
- Images
- Commit messages
